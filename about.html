            The colours popping throughout, the theme-relevant artworks designed
            from scratch by the student teams, the elegance in student groups
            coming together after all the effort they put in until the day of
            the fest cannot be looked past.

          <p id="about1">
            A 12 year legacy, still burning bright and being passed down to the
            coming batches is a standing example of the camaraderie the students
            share even between the passing batches. It shows a great promise in
            terms of offering a unique experience to students through a plethora
            of events that strengthen their technical and all-round abilities.

          <p>
            Computer science and information technology (IT) are two related but
            distinct fields that deal with the processing, storage, and
            transmission of information.Computer science focuses on the
            theoretical and practical aspects of computing, including
            algorithms, data structures, programming languages, software design,
            and computer architecture.Information technology, on the other hand,
            is a more applied field that deals with the implementation and
            management of computer-based systems, networks, and databases.
